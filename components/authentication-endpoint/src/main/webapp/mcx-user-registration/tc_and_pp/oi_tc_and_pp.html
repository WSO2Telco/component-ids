			<li style="margin-bottom:5px;">We may immediately suspend or terminate Your access to the Service if You violate any of these Terms and Conditions. We will have no liability or obligation to You if we suspend or terminate Your access on account of this violation.</li>
			<li style="margin-bottom:5px;">We are not responsible for any third-party services that you access while using Mobile Connect. You access those services at your own risk.  You must contact the third-party service directly if you encounter any issues. </li>
			<li style="margin-bottom:5px;">Third-party services may have their own terms and conditions, and third-parties may charge you for their services. It is Your responsibility to review and understand any third-party terms and conditions.</li>
		</ul>

		<p style="font-size:12px; margin-bottom:5px;"><strong>1. Usage Rules</strong></p>

		<p style="font-size:12px; margin-bottom:5px; text-align: justify;">You agree to use the Service in compliance with these usage rules. We reserve the right to modify the usage rules at any time.</p>
		<p style="font-size:12px; margin-bottom:5px; text-align: justify;">You are authorized to use the Service, and to download, install and use the Mobile Connect App, solely for the purpose of using the Service, and in accordance with these Terms and Conditions. This authorization is exclusive to You and is not transferrable by You.</p>

		<p style="font-size:12px; margin-bottom:5px; text-align: justify;">You agree that the Service, including but not limited to trademarks, user interface, scripts and software used to implement the Service, contains proprietary information owned by Us or our third-party service providers, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws.

		<p style="font-size:12px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:5px;"><strong>3. Use of your Personal Information and Your Privacy</strong></p>

		<p style="font-size:12px; margin-bottom:5px; text-align: justify;">We’ll only ask you for personal information and use it when it is necessary and with your permission to support the Service. When You first choose to use Mobile Connect We will ask You for your mobile number so We can verify that it is on our network and to help You use Your mobile device for safer log-ins from that point on. The Service is designed to respect and help protect Your privacy, so We won’t share your personal information with the website or app you’re logging into without Your permission, not even Your mobile number.  When You give us your mobile number, We replace it with a code that can’t be reverse-engineered, and We only share that code with the website or app. We believe it should be your choice to share Your mobile number.</p>
		<p style="font-size:12px; margin-bottom:5px; text-align: justify;">Because We want Your experience to be as easy and convenient as possible, We also use cookies.  A ‘cookie’ is a small text file placed on Your computer, tablet or mobile device.  Our use of cookies can’t identify You personally and We don’t use them for advertising. We only use them to remember things such as your language preferences or settings for the Service, so You don’t have to do this each time you use the Service (which might be very annoying). To make it easy, We utilise a pre-checked ‘remember me’ box – just uncheck the box if You prefer not to be remembered, and definitely uncheck the box if You are using a shared computer or device.</p>

		<p style="font-size:12px;  margin-bottom:5px; text-align: justify;">Like many other companies, We work with third-parties to help provide the Service and those third-parties may process Your personal information on our behalf.  We require that all third parties must comply with strict obligations and standards to ensure that personal information is handled properly and securely at all times. We value your trust in Us.</p>
		<p style="font-size:12px;  margin-bottom:5px; text-align: justify;">Your trust is important to Us, and We will not share or sell Your personal information or use it or for direct marketing purposes.</p>
		<p style="font-size:12px;  margin-bottom:5px; text-align: justify;">If you want to contact Us about how your personal information is used please do so by visiting <a href="" target="_blank"><u>privacy url</u></a></p>
		<p style="font-size:12px;  margin-bottom:5px; text-align: justify;">We reserve the right to disclose any information provided by You to law enforcement authorities, government officials or other third-parties if We believe such disclosure is reasonably necessary or appropriate to enforce and/or verify compliance with any part of these Terms and Conditions, or for Us to comply with any legal process.</p>
		<p style="font-size:12px;  margin-bottom:5px; text-align: justify;">This privacy policy will be read in conjunction with Our privacy policy.</p>

Your continued use of the Service will be deemed acceptance thereof.</p>
